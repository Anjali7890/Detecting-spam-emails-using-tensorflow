# Detecting-spam-emails-using-tensorflow
## This project implements a deep learning model to classify emails as Spam or Ham (Not Spam) using TensorFlow & LSTM.
## The dataset is preprocessed with text cleaning, stopword removal, tokenization, and padding before training an LSTM-based neural network.

# Features
## Preprocessing of raw emails (punctuation & stopword removal)
## Balancing of dataset to handle class imbalance
## WordCloud visualization for spam vs ham emails
## Tokenization & padding for sequence modeling
## LSTM-based deep learning model for classification
## Early stopping & learning rate scheduling for optimal training
## Performance visualization with accuracy plots

# Tech Stack
## Python 3
## TensorFlow / Keras
## NLTK (Stopwords removal)
## WordCloud (Visualization)
## Seaborn / Matplotlib (EDA & plots)

# Results

## Balanced dataset accuracy: ~90–95%
## Model: Embedding + LSTM + Dense layers
## Output:
## 0 → Ham (Not Spam)
## 1 → Spam
